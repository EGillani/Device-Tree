# Device-Tree

This project is about starting with a class-hierarchy design and then using that design to build a simple web user interface to enable viewing and editing the properties of any objects created.
The main concept here is to create a simulated controller that allows all devices of a specific type to be monitored, updated, enabled and disabled.
